# UpDate

UpDate is an intelligent embedded system which utilizes phone activity and habits to display crucial information to your very own private group.

## No More Miscommuication

Currently, lack of communication in a household raises stress levels and may keep people on edge. As information becomes digital due to more social media presence, assumptions become more prevalent and verbal communication drops.

What if there was a way to track your habits and communicate your desires autonomously in real-time? Designed for families or college roommates, UpDate shares your activity or any important requests in real-time.

## Security is Extremely Important to us

UpDate requires a user authentication, with future goals of enabling a 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) to keep you and your group's information secure.

You cannot join a group unless first invited with your userID/code.

Most importantly, each user is able to set their personal security information:
 - Don't want your GPS location visible?  Disable GPS Tracking in-app
 - Don't want the app tracking phone-use? Disable background usage
